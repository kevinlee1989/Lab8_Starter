## Short paragraph about graceful degradation and service workers.
Graceful degradation means designing applications to maintain functionality when some of the functions or features fails or not supported. Service workers support this concept by making the web applications to work offline or under poor network environment. By caching assets and intercepting network requests, service workers make sure that users can still access to the major content and features of the web application, enhancing user experience even when connectivity degrades.
